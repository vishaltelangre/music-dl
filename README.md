### How to get/create an API key for YouTube?

YouTube requires an API key to allow searching the tracks.
That is why `music-dl` needs it.

Please follow instructions provided on [this wiki](https://github.com/vishaltelangre/music-dl/wiki/How-to-get-or-create-a-YouTube-API-Key%3F).

You will need to provide it only once using following command,
which will be stored at `$HOME/.music-dl.json` on your computer.

```
music-dl -k API_KEY_HERE
```

### Does it really download from these sites?

Nope, it doesn't.
It just retrieves the list of songs
and information such as title, album, artists, etc.
from these sites.
It then downloads the matching music from YouTube.
